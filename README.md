# team-port

This is an application where the user can build a webpage that showcases their team members. Team members for this application include managers, engineers and interns.
In the command line the user is presented with a few prompts. It will begin by prompting the Manager. In that prompt the user will have to supply the Managers name
and will have optional prompts such as ID, email and office number. It will then prompt the user if they would like to add another team memeber. 
If the user chooses to add an engineer they will again be prompted with optional questions such as ID, email and github. If the user goes on to add an Intern
they will be prompted with questions such as ID, email and Schooling. The user will then have the option to be done with adding team members and the command line will 
supply the message "Team complete"

## Webpage

The webpage will generate under the dist/ and the user will be able to deploy to their web broswer of choice.
